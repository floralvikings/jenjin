/**
 * The {@code ClientActor} class is used to represent a server-side {@code Actor} object on the client side.  It is an
 * object capable of movement.
 * <p/>
 * Actors start with a {@code MoveState} with {@code MoveState.IDLE}.  Each update, the Actor checks to see if
 * there are any MoveStates in the queue.  If there are, it checks the first state in line for the number of steps
 * needed before the state changes.  Once the number of steps has been reached, the state switches to that of the first
 * position in the queue, and the Actor's step counter is reset.  If an Actor "oversteps," which is determined if the
 * Actor has taken more than the required number of steps to change state, the Actor is moved back by the "overstepped"
 * number of states, the Actor's state is updated, and the Actor then takes the number of extra steps in the correct
 * relativeAngle.
 * <p/>
 * An Actor's state is considered "changed" when the Actor is facing a new relativeAngle or moving in a new
 * relativeAngle.
